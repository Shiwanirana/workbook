## What i learned in coding school is...
how to code

I was so scared because it was already thursday, and the main functionality, your many to many relationship was not figured out, how to delete that. So on wednesday night, at home i did both the modals for adding the vaults and keeps and by clicking on the vaults, on vault page i was getting the vault with all its keeps. But my main challenge was to delete the relationship. So i knew i need a vault keep id, and it was deleting the relationship easily, but it was not instant, i needed to refresh every time i deleted a vaultkeep to see the page. Then got the point that after the deletion i need to give that page all the remaining keeps of that particular vault by its vaultId. That day also i retested my backend and got one error, researched a lot, it was saying null-reference error, changed a few things and then after taking help found my mistake. By the end of the day i submitted my project and was evaluated and luckily  passed the final project with one thing left, the masonry thing, which i actually tried but then deleted, because i was not getting the required results.
