## 1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?
     REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It is an architectural style that handles client-server relationships. It is a specific way of making sure people can access things on the server and wil get the same in return, but with few rules or restrictions to follow along with.

## 2. What does Stateless mean?
    Stateless means the client data is not stored on the server. It does not have a session containing your personal details or previous requests, which means more scalable, as it does not need more memory to store information. 

## 3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
     It will require a URL that identify a user and the HTTP method GET.
