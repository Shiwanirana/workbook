how to code

## 1. What are the three types of relationships?
    1. One to One: One person can have one passport, and the passport can only be used by that person.
    2. One to Many:A person buying a pen, a book and a bag from a store. 
    3. Many to Many: Suppose you have a list of multiple students and a list of multiple classes. So a student can take multiple classes and a class can have multiple students.

## 2. What are the benefits of the traditional linking of relationships instead of Embedding?
      In traditional linking, we are using a foreign key for the linking purpose, whereas, in embedding approach, we are embedding a structure inside of a structure. Traditional linking has a benefit, as the additional structure will not increase the size of the original one and it is more readable than the other one.

## 3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
      Many to many relationship means linking multiple records of one table to multiple records of another table. One main challenge in this relationship is you can not directly implement many to many relationships. So you need to break this into two one-to-many relationships.
